# The Open 3D Engine CO3DEX
CO3DEX refers to 'The O3DE Creative Opulence and Design EXperience', we are a group of AWS and O3DE Design Technologist working towards 'Innovative First' thinking and 'Creative First' excellence. We dogfood the customer experience of building experiences utilizing Amazon technologies using solutions like 'Open 3D Engine' (O3DE), and we use this experience to influence and improve the product design, feature set, tools and end-to-end workflows (in a systems cross-cutting manner.) Thus I made a place to document and share some of our worklogs and findings. Note: this is an infromal blog style set of 'how to' write-ups and is not offical O3DE documentation.

## HogJonny-AMZN.github.io
I am a Sr. Design Technologist at AWS, in the Game Tech org, in the Game Engine and Developer Services (GE&DS) org (aka formerly the Lumberyard team.)

What was perviously Lumberyard, has now become the Open 3D Engine (aka O3DE): https://www.o3de.org/

My github profile is here: https://github.com/HogJonny-AMZN

Design Technology is where the needs of art and technology collide, as a Sr.DT I deep-dive on design, own large parts of our ecosystem, and most importantly act as First Customer ... I use the product like our customers, this is a flywheel that generates unmet customer needs and product improvements.

I've been working in a game dev related field now for nearly 30 years. My experience covers several tracks across my career; from Intern to Producer. My core background is 3D art and technologies, making games on the cutting edge. I have worked with some of the most influential companies in the industry, including EA, Activision, Atari, Take2/Rockstar and Sony (SCEA).

## So what is CO3DEX?
At Amazon Design Technologist is a builder role that writes software (code) and/or authors creative technology driven experiences. (Overlaps with Game Dev Technical Artist roles and responsibilities.) HogJonny-AMZN.github.io is an opportunity to blog about the work I do and solutions I provide within a vibrant open source community. It's also a place I can create a supplimental 'How To's' cookbook for creators that use O3DE and the DCC tool ecosystem.

## Why the Name CO3DEX?
Because it is fun and delightful and fitting.

A CODEX is a manuscript book (I just modified the name to co3dex for fun), especially of Scripture, early literature, or ancient mythological or historical annals. The earliest type of manuscript in the form of a modern book (i.e., a collection of written pages stitched together along one side), the codex replaced the earlier rolls of papyrus and wax tablets.

Fantasy Masters' Codex is a 1981 fantasy role-playing game supplement for The Fantasy Trip published by Metagaming Concepts. Fantasy Masters' Codex contains an index to all The Fantasy Trip materials published through 1980, a manuscript which lists and documents many talents, spells, magic items, potions and equipment - each sorted several ways - a DX adjustment table, a table of saving throws and listings of jobs, races and monsters.[1]
